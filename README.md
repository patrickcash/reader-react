# reader-react

Basic feed reader interface to be used in future projects

## motivation

I noticed that several of the projects I have plans to work on shared a common base interface. One or two columns on the left with list{s} in the columns and a content area on the right. (Similar to a text editor or email interface.) So I created this simple reader interface as a template to be used for later projects. If I find that I use this interface a lot I may create a fork of crete-react-app that uses this base template.

## Basic Architecture

The base reader interface is built using React and Redux along with the React-Bootstrap UI component library


## TODO:

1 Determine how much common functionality should go into this basic template
    - basic architecture should be the same between projects using this template
    - most Redux functionality should be the same between template

2 Determine how much common styling should go into this basic template
    - Should it just be a basic template with no styling except layout code?
    - Full styling to use styling code as a template as well?
